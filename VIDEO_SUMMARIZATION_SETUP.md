â”‚       â””â”€â”€ video_detail.html
```

### Database Tables
- `translation_video`: Stores uploaded video files
- `translation_videosummary`: Stores transcripts and summaries
- `translation_translationhistory`: Updated to include video type

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'whisper'"**
   - Run: `pip install openai-whisper==20231117`

2. **"FFmpeg not found"**
   - Install FFmpeg and add it to your PATH
   - Restart your command prompt/terminal

3. **"Video processing dependencies not available"**
   - Install all required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Make sure FFmpeg is installed

4. **"No speech detected"**
   - Check if the video has clear audio
   - Try with a different video file
   - Ensure the video is not corrupted

### Performance Tips

- **Smaller videos process faster:** Consider compressing large videos
- **Clear audio works better:** Videos with background noise may have lower accuracy
- **English content:** Whisper works best with English, but supports many languages

## ðŸ“Š Usage Statistics

The system tracks:
- Video duration
- Transcript word count
- Summary word count
- Compression ratio
- Processing time

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- Videos are stored in the `media/videos/` directory
- Only authenticated users can upload videos
- Users can only access their own videos
- Temporary audio files are automatically cleaned up

## ðŸ†˜ Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Django logs in `logs/django.log`
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure FFmpeg is in your PATH
4. Try with a small test video first

## ðŸŽ‰ You're All Set!

The video summarization feature is now fully integrated into your Bhashini project. Users can upload videos, get AI-generated transcripts and summaries, and manage their video library through a beautiful web interface.

Enjoy your new video summarization capabilities! ðŸŽ¬âœ¨
